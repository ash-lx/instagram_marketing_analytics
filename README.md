# Instagram Marketing Analytics

This project provides an in-depth analysis of Instagram advertisement data, showcasing key metrics such as the **Cost per Profile Visit**, **Profile Visits**, and **Spend Efficiency** across various **Post Types**, **Locations**, and **Audience Demographics**. The visualizations highlight insights that can help improve marketing strategies by analyzing different factors such as post type efficiency, geographic comparison, and overall campaign performance.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of Instagram campaign data, including the following columns:

- **S.no**: Serial number of the campaign.
- **Post Type**: Type of the Instagram post (e.g., product, reel).
- **Age Range**: The target age range for the campaign.
- **Female/Male**: Percentage of Female and Male users reached by the campaign.
- **Location**: The geographic region targeted by the campaign.
- **Accounts Reached**: Number of accounts the campaign reached.
- **Profile Visit**: The number of profile visits generated by the campaign.
- **Spent**: Total amount spent in Euros (€) on the campaign.
- **Cost per Profile Visit**: The cost to generate a single profile visit in Euros (€).

The dataset includes campaigns targeted across different locations such as Germany, France, and multiple cities (e.g., Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt).

## Visualizations

### 1. **Overall Campaign Efficiency Overview**

This bar chart visualizes the **Cost per Profile Visit** for each campaign. The height of the bars shows how efficiently each campaign managed to convert advertisement spending into profile visits. Value labels on each bar show the exact cost (€).

### 2. **Geographic Efficiency Comparison (Updated)**

This visualization compares the **Cost per Profile Visit** across different locations. An average value for **Germany** is computed and included in the comparison. This chart helps identify which geographic regions offer the best cost efficiency.

### 3. **Post Type Efficiency**

This scatter plot compares the efficiency of different post types, using **Cost per Profile Visit** as the efficiency metric. Each point represents a campaign, and the size of the points is based on the number of **Profile Visits**. The color represents the **Spent** amount, with a legend to contextualize the total ad spend per post type.

## Analysis Highlights

1. **Cost per Profile Visit by Campaign**: This chart gives a clear picture of which campaigns performed better in terms of converting spending into profile visits. Campaigns with lower bars are more efficient.

2. **Geographic Efficiency**: The comparison between locations provides actionable insights on where campaigns are most cost-efficient. The additional calculation for the **Germany (Average)** location allows for a better assessment of location performance.

3. **Post Type Efficiency**: By analyzing the post type efficiency, marketers can assess whether certain types of posts (e.g., products, reels, or multiple products) lead to better engagement with lower costs. It’s a useful insight for deciding what kind of posts to prioritize in future campaigns.
